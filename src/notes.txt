React Hooks
    React has many built in hooks
    ex: (basic hooks)
        -useState - use state in a functional component
        -useEffect - built in hook and runs "side effects" 
                Fetches data, starting a timer and manually changing the DOM = side effects
        -useContext
    Additional hooks:
        -useReducer
        -useCallback
        -useMemo
        -useRef
        etc...

        useEffect accept 2 arguments
        1. Function => side effects, runs after first render
                - will run after the first render   
                - will run after all rerenders by default
                - accept a callback function as its first arguments
                - returns undefined or a function   
                    - if your return a function, the function will run b4 the component unmount or b4 the effect runs again
